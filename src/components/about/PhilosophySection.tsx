            "Cancer treatment is not just about medical interventionsâ€”it's about treating the whole person. Each patient deserves compassion, clear communication, and a treatment plan that respects their individual needs and values."

            Dr. Neiman's approach to cancer care is guided by several core principles: personalization, compassion, education, and collaboration. She believes in treating each patient as an individual, considering not just their medical condition but their personal preferences, quality of life goals, and support systems.
